## 🎯 Project Overview

This POC demonstrates a sophisticated multimodal AI system that intelligently orchestrates multiple open-source models to generate creative content across different modalities (text, image, audio, and video). Unlike simple single-model implementations, this project showcases **agentic orchestration** where an AI agent makes intelligent decisions about which models to use, when to use them, and how to chain their outputs for complex creative workflows.

### 🚀 Key Innovation
The system acts as an **AI Creative Director** that can understand user intent and autonomously orchestrate a pipeline of specialized models to produce cohesive multimodal content. For example, given a story concept, it can generate narrative text, create matching visuals, produce background music, and even generate video sequences - all through intelligent agent-driven workflows.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 Agentic Orchestration
- **LangGraph-powered workflow engine** for complex decision-making
- **Dynamic model selection** based on task requirements and resource availability
- **Self-healing pipelines** that adapt when models fail or are unavailable
- **Context-aware chaining** where outputs from one model inform the next

### 🎭 Multimodal Generation
- **Text-to-Image**: SDXL, Stable Diffusion variants via Diffusers
- **Text-to-Audio**: Bark, MusicGen for speech and music synthesis
- **Text-to-Video**: Zeroscope, ModelScope video generation
- **Image-to-Text**: BLIP-2, LLaVA for visual understanding
- **Cross-modal reasoning** for coherent content generation

### 🔄 Intelligent Workflows
- **Creative Story Pipeline**: Story → Images → Music → Video
- **Content Adaptation Pipeline**: Single input → Multiple format outputs
- **Quality Assurance Agent**: Automatic content validation and regeneration
- **Resource Optimization**: Dynamic batching and model switching

    workflow_type="creative_story"
)

# Input: Simple story concept
story_concept = "A lonely robot discovers a garden in a post-apocalyptic city"

# The agent orchestrates the entire pipeline
result = await director.create_story_experience(

### 🎨 AI-Generated Visual Showcase

Our multimodal AI system demonstrates exceptional capability in generating high-quality, detailed images from complex text descriptions. Here are examples of the system's visual generation prowess:

#### Example 1: Cinematic Medieval Cityscape
**Prompt**: *"An expansive panoramic view of King's Landing, the dazzling capital of the Seven Kingdoms from Game of Thrones, captured in exquisite cinematic detail. The vast city sprawls across sunlit hills, its labyrinth of terracotta rooftops glowing under the warm golden afternoon light. Narrow cobblestone streets wind between bustling markets filled with colorful stalls, townsfolk in medieval garb, and horse-drawn carts. The mighty Red Keep dominates the skyline, its crimson stone towers, soaring battlements, and sharp spires casting long shadows across the city, exuding royal authority. Just beyond it rises the Great Sept of Baelor, its seven massive domes and ornate white marble façade gleaming like a beacon of faith. The city's fortified stone walls snake around the perimeter, punctuated by imposing watchtowers and massive gates, while beyond them the glittering Blackwater Bay stretches into the horizon. The harbor teems with wooden galleons, trade ships, and sleek warships, their sails catching the sea breeze as dockworkers unload crates of goods. Smoke drifts gently from hundreds of chimneys, and distant bells echo faintly, blending with the noise of the vibrant metropolis. Surrounding hillsides are dotted with patches of green farmland and olive groves, while the far-off waters shimmer in brilliant shades of sapphire and emerald. Seabirds wheel above the crashing surf, and the sky glows with streaks of amber, orange, and pale blue, creating a breathtaking contrast with the city's earthy tones. The atmosphere is alive, majestic yet dangerous, foreshadowing the great power struggles within. Rendered in ultra-detailed, high-resolution fantasy concept art, with sweeping cinematic composition, rich textures, and dramatic lighting worthy of an epic saga."*
